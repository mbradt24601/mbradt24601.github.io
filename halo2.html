<h1>Halo 2</h1>

<p>Halo 2 was the first video game I really remember playing as a kid. My brothers and I would fight over the controller that had the least number of issues connecting to the xbox. Whoever lost usually ended up with the controller that had a faulty cord that would only work if you held it at exactly the right angle.</p>

<br>

<p>Some reasons Halo 2 is still one of my favorites</p>

<ul class="list" style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>I grew up playing the game with my dad and 5 brothers.</li>
    <li>I have fond memories of referring to the alien blood as "purple jelly" at every possible chance.</li>
    <li>It was one of few reasons my parents let me stay up late as a kid.</li>
    <li>My dad usually shared his stash of oreos with us during our Halo marathons.</li>
    <li>The energy sword is still one of the coolest weapon designs in any game.</li>
</ul>
