<h1>Warframe</h1>


<p>Warframe clears all the other games. It is an S tier game. You cannot convince me otherwise. First, the in-game currency can be traded for items. Which pretty much means that with enough time, you can get almost any item in the game completely free. It's also a free to play game. And that's not even about any of the game play. Please appreciate the character design provided below.</p>

<p>Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. And the character, her name is Yareli, looks exactly like that in game as well. Some games promo with much better looking versions of their stuff than what's in the game. Not this one. What you see is what you get. And the colors are fully customizable.</p>

<p>The gameplay is fantastic. This game came out around 10 years ago, so it's been around, but the developers consistently put out content, bug fixes, and responses to community recommendations. This is another game that I love because of its ability to combine fun gun mechanics with creative abilities for each character. Below are a few of my favorite characters and their stats according to me. Obviously, they are all ranked really high.</p>
