<h1>Skyrim</h1>

<p>Skyrim was probably one of the first story-oriented games I played. As an avid reader, I loved jumping into a story world where I could actually see unique character designs and how magical powers might look. I also loved the skill system. It was my first experience with leveling a character so much that your character was actually unstoppable.</p>

<p>Oh, and don't even get me started on the character selection screen. I spent hours trying to pick what I wanted my character to look like, but more importantly, the different focus options. I think this was also the first game that had less limited presets for different body types (and surprise, female characters!)</p>

<p>Skyrim's intro was great, and the memes that came from it were even better. If you know, you know.</p>
